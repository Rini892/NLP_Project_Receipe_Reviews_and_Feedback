# Recipe Reviews Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing

An end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) project on the Recipe Reviews and User Feedback dataset, covering data understanding, exploratory data analysis (EDA), text preprocessing, sentiment classification, text vectorization, traditional machine learning models, deep learning with BiLSTM, and model evaluation.

### NLP Project

Dataset: Recipe Reviews and User Feedback Dataset

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing user reviews and feedback for recipes using Natural Language Processing techniques.

The main objective is to classify recipe reviews into three sentiment categories — **Negative, Neutral, and Positive** — based on the star ratings associated with each review.

The project follows a complete NLP workflow, beginning with data exploration and cleaning, followed by text preprocessing and sentiment-label creation. Different text representation techniques and machine learning models are then compared to identify an effective approach for sentiment classification.

The project implements both traditional machine learning techniques and a deep learning approach using a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model.

## Dataset Information

### Dataset Name

**Recipe Reviews and User Feedback Dataset**

The dataset contains user reviews and feedback associated with recipes. Each record contains information about the recipe, reviewer, review text, ratings, and user engagement.

### Dataset Source

**UCI Machine Learning Repository**

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/911/recipe+reviews+and+user+feedback+dataset

### Dataset Size

* Initial Records: **18,182**
* Initial Features: **15**
* Text Column: `text`
* Rating Column: `stars`
* Number of Recipe Entries: **100**

### Problem Type

**Multiclass Sentiment Classification**

The project converts the original star ratings into three sentiment categories.

### Target Variable

The sentiment labels are created from the `stars` column:

| Star Rating | Sentiment |
| ----------- | --------- |
| 1–2 Stars   | Negative  |
| 3 Stars     | Neutral   |
| 4–5 Stars   | Positive  |

Reviews with invalid/unrated star values are excluded from the final sentiment-classification dataset.

After sentiment-label creation, the dataset contains:

| Sentiment | Number of Reviews |
| --------- | ----------------: |
| Positive  |            15,107 |
| Negative  |               509 |
| Neutral   |               476 |

The dataset is therefore highly imbalanced, with positive reviews representing the majority of the observations.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The project begins with an initial analysis of the dataset to understand its structure and quality.

The following steps were performed:

* Dataset loading
* Inspection of the first records
* Dataset shape analysis
* Data type inspection
* Statistical summary
* Unique-value analysis
* Missing-value analysis
* Duplicate-value analysis
* Review and recipe analysis
* Star-rating distribution
* Sentiment distribution
* Text-related exploration

The original dataset contains **18,182 rows and 15 columns**. Two reviews contain missing values in the text field and are removed during preprocessing.

---

## Data Preprocessing Pipeline

The following preprocessing steps were applied to prepare the review text for NLP modeling.

### Missing Value Handling

Missing review text values were identified and removed from the dataset.

```python
df_review.dropna(subset=["text"], inplace=True)
```

### Duplicate Analysis

Duplicate records were examined to ensure the quality of the dataset before modeling.

### Text Cleaning

The review text and recipe names were cleaned using several techniques:

* Convert text to lowercase
* Remove punctuation
* Detect and remove URLs
* Decode HTML entities
* Detect and process emojis
* Remove unnecessary characters
* Tokenize text
* Remove English stopwords
* Lemmatize words

The notebook specifically checks for URLs in review text and removes them before further processing.

### Text Normalization

Text was normalized into a consistent format before feature extraction and model training.

---

## Sentiment Label Creation

The original `stars` rating is converted into a three-class sentiment variable.

The mapping used is:

```text
1–2 Stars → Negative
3 Stars   → Neutral
4–5 Stars → Positive
```

Reviews without a valid sentiment label are removed.

The resulting sentiment distribution is:

```text
Positive    15107
Negative      509
Neutral       476
```

This significant class imbalance is an important characteristic of the dataset and should be considered when interpreting model performance.

---

## Train-Test Split

After preprocessing and sentiment-label generation, the review text and sentiment labels are divided into training and testing datasets.

The resulting split used in the notebook is:

| Dataset      | Number of Samples |
| ------------ | ----------------: |
| Training Set |            12,873 |
| Testing Set  |             3,219 |

The training data is used to learn vocabulary and model parameters, while the test data is reserved for final evaluation.

---

# Text Vectorization

Text must be converted into numerical representations before it can be used by traditional machine learning algorithms.

Two classical vectorization techniques were implemented:

* Bag of Words
* TF-IDF

---

## Bag of Words

The Bag of Words representation uses `CountVectorizer` with:

* Maximum features: **5,000**
* N-gram range: **1–2**
* Minimum document frequency: **2**
* Maximum document frequency: **0.95**

The resulting matrices are:

```text
Training Shape : (12873, 5000)
Testing Shape  : (3219, 5000)
Vocabulary Size: 5000
```

The Bag of Words representation was evaluated using:

* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)

---

## TF-IDF Vectorization

TF-IDF was implemented using `TfidfVectorizer`.

Configuration:

* Maximum features: **10,000**
* N-gram range: **1–2**
* Minimum document frequency: **2**
* Maximum document frequency: **0.95**
* Sublinear TF enabled

The resulting matrices are:

```text
Training Shape : (12873, 10000)
Testing Shape  : (3219, 10000)
Vocabulary Size: 10000
```

TF-IDF representations were evaluated using:

* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)

---

# Machine Learning Methodology

---

## Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression was trained using both:

* Bag of Words
* TF-IDF

The TF-IDF Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of approximately **90.90%** and a weighted F1-score of approximately **92.32%**.

---

## Support Vector Machine

A linear SVM classifier was trained using both:

* Bag of Words
* TF-IDF

The TF-IDF SVM model achieved an accuracy of approximately **92.58%** and a weighted F1-score of approximately **93.04%**.

Among the traditional machine learning models, TF-IDF with SVM produced the strongest overall results.

---

# Deep Learning Model

## BiLSTM

A Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural network was implemented to capture sequential and contextual information from the review text.

### Tokenization

The Keras tokenizer was configured with:

```text
Maximum Vocabulary Size = 10,000
Maximum Sequence Length  = 100
```

The reviews were converted into numerical sequences and padded to a fixed length of 100 tokens.

Resulting shapes:

```text
X_train_pad: (12873, 100)
X_test_pad : (3219, 100)
```

### BiLSTM Architecture

The model consists of:

```text
Embedding Layer
       ↓
Bidirectional LSTM
       ↓
Dropout
       ↓
Dense Softmax Output
```

The main configuration includes:

* Embedding dimension: **128**
* LSTM units: **64**
* Bidirectional LSTM
* Dropout: **0.5**
* Output classes: **3**
* Activation function: **Softmax**

Early stopping was used during training to reduce overfitting.

The model was trained for up to 10 epochs with:

* Batch size: **32**
